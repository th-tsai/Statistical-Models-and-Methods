# Statistical Models and Methods

## Introducation

In this repositories, I would revisit the coursework form module Statistical Models and Methods. 

Previously, the coursework required us to use a linear model to tackle the problems.

However, I will expand the models using generalised linear model, decision tree and random forest.

All coding will bases on Python with relevant packages.

## Data

The training and test data set store in the Data file.
